I was intrigued by the "layer upon layer" cloud art piece I found on OpenProcessing, which utilized a progressive emergence of cloud layers. Drawing inspiration from this, I wish to incorporate its recursive layering structure into my project, creating complex and alluring visual dynamics. Given the assignment's emphasis on achieving visual depth, this technique can be instrumental. By emulating such natural phenomena through coding, we can elevate the artwork's realism and captivation. Integrating these elements aligns perfectly with our project's objectives and can make the final presentation stand out.
